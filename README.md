# Comprehensive test of Java outputstream
### Works with Oracle OpenJDK version 20.0.1 - Future compatibility not implemented yet

This tool is a public service and made with heavy dedication and devotion to help programmers confirm that they can, in fact, send data of the String class to the outputstream in order to display the content to users of their application with their current configuration. No additional packages or libraries needed to use!

**WARNING - FOR USE BY ADVANCED USERS ONLY. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO UTILIZE THIS TOOL WITHOUT A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE JDK, JRE, JFK, AND KFC.**

## Steps to use: 
<ol>
  <li>Absorb the contents of this readme thoroughly</li>
  <li>Navigate to the "code" dropdown button element on this GitHub repository's page</li>
  <li>Click on the button that packages this repository into a Zip Archive File (ZIP) in order to create a local copy of this project into the downloads directory of your computing device</li>
  <li>Extract the ZIP archive into any directory in your computing device</li>
  <li>Open the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice, utilizing the application to read and open the extracted directory as a project, configured for the Java programming language</li>
  <li>Press the round element of a hue of any hex value (a button) that encompasses a label such as "run", "run code", or any other text data that indicates that a user can utilize the button to allow the computer to read the code in the project created from the extracted directory, build the Java project by reading the text data of any relevant Java Class file(s), compiling them into binary machine code, check the file for any possible errors, and execute the program, theoretically altering the state of the individual pixels on the Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) or other type of computer display to resemble two members of the English lexicon, including "Hello" and "World", followed by a symbol of emphasis (exclamation mark)</li>
